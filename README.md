# Project Two - The Food Project
This project is for the purpose of a band called The Monkees, they requested that they wanted a website with some information about them, such as images, clips, about us and a contact page.

The project servers as a purpose for the user to find all the material they need about The Monkees, if they wish to contact The Monkees representatives they can submit a form to get in touch. The website is also responsive and can be used on all mobile devices.

# UX
The wireframe is located here: https://github.com/GameRockUK/projectone/blob/master/Wireframe/wireframeprojectonehomepage.png

The only wireframe created was for the homepage, once we built the homepage that then set the theme for the rest of the website so I chose not to create additional wireframes.

The reason why we chose the layout above is because we wanted the site to be simplistic, we didn't want there to be lots of objects on-scree, we just wanted a website with easy accessible information.

# Features
Pages

The site is a restaurant site which details what the restaurant has to offer and offers a interactive map for users to use to locate the 
restaurant.

# Testing
This project has been heavily tested and been tested for responsiveness, works perfectly on all devices to ensure the user can view all the details
and interact with the map on any device.

# Deployment
There are no differences between the development version and the release version. To release the project we pushed the git from AWS to Github.com via the command line.

Technologies Used
The technologies used are:

Bootstrap framework (http://www.getbootstrap.com) HTML/CSS Google Chrome

We use a Google Maps Javascript API to be able to pull the interactive map to the website.

We used Bootstrap so the navigation bar has certain styles implemented by the Boostrap framework, this really helped shape the website we set out to deliver for the project. We also used the Jumbotron which is a pre-defined style from Bootstrap which helped shape the content on the pages.

# Content
All text was created by myself and no text was taken from any other website.
